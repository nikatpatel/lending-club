In "Neural network survival analysis for personal loan data" the authors
describe several issues that we had with our analysis including inputs
that vary in meaning and importance over time and scaling a prediction
for better performance while not exceeding our computing resources.

In "Weapons of Math Destruction" ONeil has a full chapter on inequality in 
the loan industry. One of her biggest points is this can lead to a 
self-fulfilling prophecy where this discrimination is based on factors that
are exacerbated by this very discrimination. An important takeaway is to be
aware of our prejudices and to always include a mechanism for human review
for any algorithmic decision.
